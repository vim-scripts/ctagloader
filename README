This script will automatically traverse your path tree from the current directory all the way to root and load tags files found along the way.
This is often useful when you have a root ctag file for your project and you often work in some subdirectories of your projects.
For example, if you have a project structured as follows:
foo/
     bar/
     baz/
There is a ctag file (often named as tags/TAGS) in foo/ and you constantly work in foo/bar/ or foo/baz/
Say you are now in foo/bar/. If you execute "vim hello_world.c", the ctag file in foo/ will be found and loaded.
